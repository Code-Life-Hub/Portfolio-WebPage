          <!-- Talk about yourself and your passion for web development -->
          <p>After graduating from high school I wasn't sure what my calling in life was. It was two summers
            later when my college admissions coach suggested taking Computer Science I. My life hasn't been the same
            since. I found a communnity of people that I connect with and enjoy collaborating with. It has since become
            clear that software engineering is my true passion.</p>

          <p> I cannot think of anything more exciting than a bright and promising future as as software engineer.</p>

          <!-- talk about some hobbies/ interests you have other than software dev. -->
          <p>I have a few interests other than software development, for starters I have to mention my affinity for
            video
            games. I also revel in the study of military strategy and history. I keep myself somewhat active, I like to
            go
            on intense mountain biking trails. Now, if I had to put the three in a hierarchy
            it would look something like this.</p>
