      <h3>About Me</h3> <!-- Create Header for About Me section -->
      <!-- Talk about yourself and your passion for web development -->
      <p>After graduating from high school I wasn't sure what my calling in life was. It was two summers
        later when my college admissions coach suggested taking Computer Science I. My life hasn't been the same
        since. I found a communnity of people that I connect with and enjoy collaborating with. It has since become clear that software engineering is my true passion.</p>
      <p> I cannot think of anything more exciting than a bright and promising future as as software engineer.</p>
      <!-- talk about some hobbies/ interests you have other than software dev. -->
      <p>I have a few interests other than software development, for starters I have to mention my affinity for video
        games. I also revel in the study of military strategy and history. I keep myself somewhat active, I like to go on intense mountain biking trails. Now, if I had to put the three in a hierarchy
        it would look something like this.</p>
